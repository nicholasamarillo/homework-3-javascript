# homework-3-javascript

DESCRIPTION:

The purpose of this assignment was to create a random password generator with Javascript. We were given both an HTML and CSS file completed and we were supposed to finish the functionality for this Random Password Generator. This has been the most difficult assignment out of all the previous ones. We needed to really understand the logical process of how the program would run and create the random password.

FEATURES:
This website/program creates a random generated password based on the user criteria they choose. Once they hit the generate button, prompts pop up asking the user to decide what criteria they want to include in their password. Once they decide what elements they want in their password, the password itself will display on the page for the user.

TESTS:

To test the features of the website:

1. Click on the "generate" button to see if the prompts pop up at the top of the page.

2. Enter a number less than 8 and more than 128 to see the prompt tells you to input a valid number.

3. Enter an answer other than "yes" or "no" inside the prompt to see if the prompt tells you to input a valid input.

4. See if the password on the page displays and meets all of your criteria.

If all tests are passed, then HOORAY!
